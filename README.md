# Explore Bikeshare Data
### Date created
January 5th, 2023

### Project Title
Explore Bikeshare Data

### Description
In this project, I made use of R to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. I wrote code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics and making visualizations!

Questions Explored:

    1. What is the most common day of week?
    2. What is the average travel time for users in different cities?
    3. What are the counts of each user type?

### Files used

chicago.csv

washington.csv

new_york.csv
